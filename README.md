# Estimate mutation rates in a Markov branching process using approximate Bayesian computation

Through modeling fluctuation experimental data by a two-type Markov branching process, we use approximate Bayesican computation (ABC) to estimate parametres for time-varying mutation rates. Though complicated dynamic structure could be easily incorporated, codes in this repository are for constant and piece-wsoe constant mutation rate functions only.
